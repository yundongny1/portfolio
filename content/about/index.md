## Who am I?

When people ask me this question, I like to answer, 'I'm just a guy.' Hopefully this portfolio will convince you otherwise! Although this site was created as a personal portfolio for MSDS 431 at Northwestern's MSDS program, my vision for this website is for it to become a personal blog of some sorts in the future. Stay tuned for more to come!

## My Experience

I graduated from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a major in Statistics, and I'm currently working full time as a data analyst in the Music Industry while being a part-time student at [Northwestern's MSDS](https://sps.northwestern.edu/masters/data-science/) program.
